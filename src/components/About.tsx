          <p>
            As a Web3 Technical Director, I bridge the gap between traditional enterprise solutions
            and blockchain technology. With extensive experience in both backend and frontend development,
            I specialize in building scalable, secure, and innovative blockchain applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical expertise spans across multiple domains, from smart contract development
            with Solidity and Rust to building robust backend systems with Java and Spring Boot.
            I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create solutions that
            drive the future of decentralized systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my role, I lead technical teams, architect blockchain solutions, and ensure
            the delivery of high-quality, production-ready applications. I'm particularly
            focused on creating efficient, secure, and user-friendly Web3 experiences.
